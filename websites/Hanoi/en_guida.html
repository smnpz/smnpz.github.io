  <h1>HANOI RULES</h1>

  <div class="container">
    <p>The <b>Tower of Hanoi</b> is a famous mathematical game or puzzle that involves transferring a set of disks from one peg to another, using a third peg as an auxiliary, while adhering to two fundamental rules: <br><br>1) You can only move one disk at a time; <br>2) You cannot place a larger disk on top of a smaller one. <br><br>The game was invented by the French mathematician Ã‰douard Lucas in 1883 and is named after the Tower of Hanoi, a legendary structure located in Hanoi, Vietnam. <br>The Tower of Hanoi problem is a classic example of a recursive problem and can be solved using the recursive "divide and conquer" algorithm. <br><br>The optimal solution to solve the Tower of Hanoi with n disks requires 2^n - 1 moves. This means that the minimum number of moves required to solve the game doubles each time an additional disk is added. <br><br>The solution can be found recursively by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and solving them one by one. <br>The Tower of Hanoi has been used as an example in many contexts, including teaching mathematical concepts such as mathematical induction and recursive algorithms. <br>It is also a source of interest for game and puzzle enthusiasts.</p>
